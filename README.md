# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection System and Data Collector System Using Tensorflow and MTCNN. It is real time Face Mask Detection System which used MTCNN for landmark detection and use model created from the CNN architecture for face mask detection system. The data required for training and testing the model were collected from scratch using Data Collector tool which also uses MTCNN for face capture for masked and unmasked faces.
